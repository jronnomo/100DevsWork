    // 9 BONUS. Categorize New Member
    //The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.
    
    // To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

     // Input
     // Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.
     // Output
     // Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.
     // Example
     // input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9], [78, -2]]
     // output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

    let input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9], [78, -2], [55, -2], [55, 8]]



    // You are given an array(list) strarr of strings and an integer k. Your task is to return the first longest string consisting of k consecutive strings taken in the array.
    // Examples:
    // strarr = ["tree", "foling", "trashy", "blue", "abcdef", "uvwxyz"], k = 2

    // Concatenate the consecutive strings of strarr by 2, we get:

    // treefoling   (length 10)  concatenation of strarr[0] and strarr[1]
    // folingtrashy ("      12)  concatenation of strarr[1] and strarr[2]
    // trashyblue   ("      10)  concatenation of strarr[2] and strarr[3]
    // blueabcdef   ("      10)  concatenation of strarr[3] and strarr[4]
    // abcdefuvwxyz ("      12)  concatenation of strarr[4] and strarr[5]

    // Two strings are the longest: "folingtrashy" and "abcdefuvwxyz".
    // The first that came is "folingtrashy" so 
    // longest_consec(strarr, 2) should return "folingtrashy".

    // In the same way:
    // longest_consec(["zone", "abigail", "theta", "form", "libe", "zas", "theta", "abigail"], 2) --> "abigailtheta"
    // n being the length of the string array, if n = 0 or k > n or k <= 0 return "" (return Nothing in Elm, "nothing" in Erlang).
    // Note
    // consecutive strings : follow one after another without an interruption



    longestConsec(["tree", "foling", "trashy", "blue", "abcdef", "uvwxyz"], 2)

    // There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!
        
    // input
    // customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
    // n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.
    // output
    // The function should return an integer, the total time required.
        
    // Important
    // Please look at the examples and clarifications below, to ensure you understand the task correctly :)
        
    // Examples
    // queueTime([5,3,4], 1)
    // // should return 12
    // // because when there is 1 till, the total time is just the sum of the times
        
    // queueTime([10,2,3,3], 2)
    // // should return 10
    // // because here n=2 and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th people in the
    // // queue finish before the 1st person has finished.
        
    // queueTime([2,3,10], 2)
    // // should return 12
    // Clarifications
    // There is only ONE queue serving many tills, and
    // The order of the queue NEVER changes, and
    // The front person in the queue (i.e. the first element in the array/list) proceeds to a till as soon as it becomes free.
    // N.B. You should assume that all the test input will be valid, as specified above.
        
    // P.S. The situation in this kata can be likened to the more-computer-science-related idea of a thread pool, with relation to running multiple processes at the same time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool
